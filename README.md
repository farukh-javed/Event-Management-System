```

## Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:
- **Python 3.x**
- **Flask**: `pip install Flask`
- **MySQL**: Ensure you have MySQL server installed and running.
- **pymysql**: `pip install pymysql`

## MySQL Setup Instructions

Before running the application, you need to set up the MySQL database.

### 1. MySQL Configuration in `app.py`

The MySQL connection details in `app.py` are:
```python
app.config['MYSQL_HOST'] = '127.0.0.1'
app.config['MYSQL_USER'] = 'root'
app.config['MYSQL_PASSWORD'] = '12345'
app.config['MYSQL_DB'] = 'EMS'
```
**Ensure that your MySQL configuration matches these values**. If your credentials differ:
- Update the `app.config` section in `app.py` with your own MySQL host, username, password, and database name.

### 2. Running the SQL Script

To set up the database structure, follow these steps:
1. **Open MySQL Workbench** or use the **MySQL command line**.
2. **Run the provided SQL script** (`ems.sql`) to create the necessary tables for the system.

**Using MySQL command line**:
```bash
mysql -u root -p EMS < path_to_event_management.sql
```
This will create all the necessary tables like `Events`, `Attendees`, `Venues`, etc., based on the structure defined in the script.

## Running the Project
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash

   ```
3. Run the Flask application:
   ```bash
   python app.py
   ```
4. Open your browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://127.0.0.1:5000
   ```

## ⚙️ Usage
1. **Login** using the credentials:
   - Username: `ucp`
   - Password: `ucp123`
2. View the list of events, and click on any event for detailed information.
3. Logout using the button in the header.
